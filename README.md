# Repo Therapist 🛋️

> Your codebase explains itself under pressure

Repo Therapist is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that turns any repository into queryable, explainable knowledge. Ask questions about your codebase through Cursor and get structured, insightful answers.

## What it does

You ask Cursor things like:
- "Why is this service structured like this?"
- "What will break if I remove this?"
- "Which parts of this repo scare you?"

Behind the scenes, Repo Therapist:
- Reads your repo structure and files
- Analyzes git history and commit patterns
- Correlates code with change frequency
- Identifies complexity hotspots and risks

## Available Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `analyze_repo(path)` | Analyze a repository - run this first |
| `get_snapshot(section?)` | Get the static snapshot (ground truth) of the repo |
| `get_history(section?)` | Get git history analysis (the time dimension) |
| `why_is_this_weird(file_path)` | Explain why a specific file is the way it is |
| `ask_repo(question)` | Ask any question about the analyzed repo |
| `repo_summary()` | Get a high-level overview |
| `risk_report()` | Generate a risk assessment report |

### Ground Truth: The Snapshot

When you run `analyze_repo`, Repo Therapist creates a **static snapshot** - the authoritative source of truth about your repository. This snapshot includes:

```json
{
  "files": [...],           // Every file with path, language, line count
  "languages": {...},       // Language breakdown with percentages
  "entryPoints": [...],     // Detected entry points with confidence levels
  "configs": {...},         // Parsed package.json, tsconfig, Dockerfile, CI configs
  "directories": [...]      // Directory structure with inferred purposes
}
```

**Why this matters:** LLMs must cite this snapshot data, not guess. When you ask "What languages does this repo use?", the answer comes from the snapshot - not from the LLM making assumptions.

Use `get_snapshot` to retrieve specific sections:
- `get_snapshot(section: "files")` - All files with metadata
- `get_snapshot(section: "languages")` - Language statistics
- `get_snapshot(section: "entryPoints")` - Detected entry points
- `get_snapshot(section: "configs")` - Parsed configuration files
- `get_snapshot(section: "directories")` - Directory structure
- `get_snapshot()` - Summary of everything

### Git Historian: The Time Dimension

The Git Historian analyzes commit history to explain **WHY** code is the way it is. This is where it stops being cute.

```json
{
  "fileChurn": { "auth.ts": { "totalCommits": 47, "churnScore": 85 } },
  "authors": { "auth.ts": ["alice", "bob", "charlie"] },
  "fragileFiles": [{ "path": "auth.ts", "reasons": ["high-churn", "many-authors"] }],
  "hotPaths": [...],
  "stableCore": [...]
}
```

**This lets you answer:**
- "Why is this weird?" → "Because it's been rewritten 12 times in 6 months."
- "Who owns this file?" → "Disputed - 4 people have modified it, none with >30%."
- "What should I be careful with?" → "These 5 files are fragile and bug-prone."

Use `get_history` to retrieve specific aspects:
- `get_history(section: "churn")` - File change frequency and volatility
- `get_history(section: "authors")` - Contributor statistics
- `get_history(section: "fragile")` - Files likely to cause problems
- `get_history(section: "hotPaths")` - Hot paths vs stable core
- `get_history(section: "timeline")` - Key events and commit patterns
- `get_history(section: "ownership")` - Who owns what
- `get_history()` - Summary of everything

Use `why_is_this_weird` for specific file analysis:
```
Use why_is_this_weird on "src/auth/login.ts"
```

Returns a detailed explanation with citations:
```
# Why is "src/auth/login.ts" the way it is?

## Change History
- Total commits: 47
- Authors: 5 (alice, bob, charlie, dave, eve)
- Churn score: 85 ⚠️ HIGH

## 🔍 Why It's Unusual
**Heavily modified:** This file has been changed 47 times...
**Many hands:** 5 different people have modified this file...
```

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd repo-therapist
npm install
```

### 2. Build the project

```bash
npm run build
```

### 3. Add to Cursor

Open Cursor Settings → MCP → Add new MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repo-therapist": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/FULL/PATH/TO/repo-therapist/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important:** Replace `/FULL/PATH/TO/` with the actual absolute path to your repo-therapist folder.

Example:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "repo-therapist": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Users/saar/Projects/private/repo-therapist/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Restart Cursor

After adding the MCP config, restart Cursor for changes to take effect.

## FAQ

### Do I need to run repo-therapist separately?

**No.** Cursor automatically starts and manages the MCP server for you. When you add the config to Cursor's MCP settings, Cursor will:
- Start the `node dist/index.js` process when needed
- Keep it running in the background
- Communicate with it via stdio (standard input/output)

You just need to build once (`npm run build`), add the config, and restart Cursor. That's it.

### Where do I ask questions?

**In the normal Cursor chat** (Cmd+L or the chat panel). The difference is *how* you ask:

- **Without MCP:** "What does this repo do?" → Cursor uses its built-in tools
- **With Repo Therapist:** "Use `analyze_repo` on `/path/to/repo`" → Cursor calls the MCP tool

You explicitly tell Cursor to use the repo-therapist tools. Cursor sees them as additional capabilities it can use.

### What's the difference vs normal Cursor chat?

| Normal Cursor Chat | With Repo Therapist |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Reads files on demand | Pre-analyzes entire repo structure |
| No git history awareness | Analyzes commit patterns & churn |
| Answers based on what it reads | Answers based on structured analysis |
| No risk detection | Identifies complexity hotspots |
| Generic code understanding | Domain-specific insights ("what scares you?") |

**The key difference:** Repo Therapist does *structured analysis* upfront and stores it, so questions like "which files change most often?" or "what are the risks?" can be answered from pre-computed data rather than Cursor having to figure it out each time.

Think of it as: Cursor is smart but reactive. Repo Therapist gives it a "briefing document" about your codebase that it can reference.

## Usage

Once configured, you can use Repo Therapist in Cursor chat:

### Step 1: Analyze a repo

First, analyze the repository you want to explore:

```
Use analyze_repo to analyze /path/to/some/repo
```

### Step 2: Ask questions

Now you can ask questions:

```
Use ask_repo to answer: "What does this repo do?"
```

```
Use ask_repo to answer: "Which parts of this repo scare you?"
```

```
Use ask_repo to answer: "What will break if I remove the auth module?"
```

### Step 3: Get reports

Get a summary:
```
Use repo_summary to show me an overview
```

Get a risk assessment:
```
Use risk_report to identify potential issues
```

## Example Questions

- "What does this repo do?"
- "How is the code structured?"
- "What tech stack is being used?"
- "Show me the dependencies"
- "Which files are the largest?"
- "What files change most often?"
- "Who are the contributors?"
- "What are the recent commits?"
- "Which parts scare you?"
- "What will break if I change X?"

## Development

### Run in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Run tests

```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:watch    # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage report
```

### Testing Guidelines

> **Note:** Always add unit tests when implementing new features.

Tests are located in `tests/` and use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). The test structure mirrors the source:

```
tests/
├── fixtures/           # Test utilities and mock repos
│   └── setup.ts        # Helper functions for creating test repos
├── scanner/            # Scanner module tests
├── historian/          # Historian module tests
├── tools/              # Tool tests
└── cache.test.ts       # Cache tests
```

When adding a new feature:
1. Create tests in the appropriate `tests/` subdirectory
2. Use `createTestRepo()` from `fixtures/setup.ts` for git-related tests
3. Clean up test repos with `cleanupTestRepo()` in `afterAll`
4. Run `npm test` to verify all tests pass before committing
